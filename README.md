## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

Can't really say there was a process but i'll try.

- I built out the HTML skeleton first
- I saved all the values from the style-guide into sass variables
- Built out all the css components bit by bit
- Constructed theming logic then created the mixin for it
- Added hover and active states and transitions

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- I learned that Sass is really the best thing since sliced bread. Really though, using Sass made my life so much easier and i had fun learning how to use mixins.

- Go through my sass file to see my themer mixin.

### Continued development

Building out the JS of this was challenging but in the best way. It helped me realize that i need to work on my fundamentals more so i can move to a framework like React that would help streamline my workflow. SO i've decided that that's what i'll be doing next. But first, i will finish all th epurely HTML & CSS challenges on Frontend Mentor

### Useful resources

- [Sass Basics](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - This helped me familiarize myself with Sass
